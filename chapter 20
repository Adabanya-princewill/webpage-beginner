1. A site diagram is useful for planning and visualizing how information is organized on the site. It should be done
very early in the design process, as soon as the content and functionality of the site have been determined. The
site diagram becomes a valuable reference for the whole production team.
2. A look and feel study is a sketch or series of sketches that propose graphic styles for the site. It focuses on how
the site looks rather than how it works.
3. There are many things that should be determined before production begins, including answers to questions like
those in the Some Questions Before You Begin sidebar, but some other general tasks include: determining the site
idea and strategy, getting information about your target audience, generate content, organize site content, create
a site diagram that reflects the organization, create wireframe diagrams to show page layout and functionality,
and develop the graphic look and feel.
4. The beta release incorporates changes from the initial alpha prototype and is close to a working version of the
site. At the very least, the client is invited to review it, but some sites choose to make beta releases available to a
broader audience.
5. At minimum, sites should be checked to make sure that all the content is there and accessible, that there are no
typos or errors, that all the links work, that images are visible, and that scripts and applications are functioning
properly. Beyond that, it is also important to test the siteâ€™s look and performance on a wide variety of browsing
environments and conditions.
