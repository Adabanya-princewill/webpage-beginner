1. You can license to have exclusive rights to an image, so that your competitor doesn’t use the same photo on their
site.

2. ppi stands for “pixels per inch” and is a measure of resolution.

3. The 7-inch, 72ppi image is only 504 pixels across and would fit fine on a web page. The 4-inch, 300 ppi image is
1200 pixels across, which is too wide for most pages.

4. Indexed color is a mode for storing color information in an image that stores each pixel color in a color table. GIF
and 8-bit PNG formats are indexed color images.

5. There are 256 colors in an 8-bit graphic, and 32 colors in a 5-bit graphic.

6. GIF can contain animation and transparency. JPEG cannot.

7. Lossy compression is cumulative, which means you lose image data every time you save an image as a JPEG. If
you open a JPEG and save it as a JPEG again, even more image information is thrown out than the first time you
saved it. Be sure to keep your full-quality original and save JPEG copies as needed.

8. PNGs can store 8-bit indexed color, RGB color (both 24- and 48-bit) and 16-bit grayscale images.

9. In binary transparency, a pixel is either entirely transparent or entirely opaque. Alpha transparency allows up to
256 levels of transparency.

10. GIF or PNG-8 because it is text, flat colors, and hard edges. (B) JPEG because it is a photograph. (C) GIF or
PNG-8 because although it has some photographic areas, most of the image is flat colors with hard edges. (D) GIF
or PNG-8 because it is a flat graphical image. (E) JPEG because it is a photograph.
