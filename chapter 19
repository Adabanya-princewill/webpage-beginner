1. Smaller graphic files means shorter download and display times. Every second counts toward creating a favorable
user experience of your site.
2. Dithering introduces a speckle pattern that interrupts strings of identical pixels, therefore the GIF compression
scheme canâ€™t compress areas with dithering as efficiently as flat colors.
3. The fewer pixel colors in the image, the smaller the resulting GIF, both because the image can be stored at a lower
bit depth and because there are more areas of similar color for the GIF to compress.
4. The compression setting is the most effective tool for controlling the size of a JPEG.
5. JPEG compression works effectively on smooth or blurred areas, so introducing a slight blur allows the JPEG
compression to work more efficiently, resulting in smaller files.
6. Just as you would do for an indexed GIF, optimize a PNG-8 by designing with flat colors, reducing the number
of colors, and avoiding dithering. There are no strategies for optimizing a PNG-24 because they are designed to
store images with lossless compression.
